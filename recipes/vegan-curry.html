      <li>
        In a large skillet with high walls, over medium heat, add oil. Add onion
        and cook until softened. Toss in garlic, thyme and ginger to cook for an
        additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add in your chopped tomatoes and cook for a few minutes to soften.
        Push down on tomatoes to help fall apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together tomato paste and water and add in with all the spices (from
        curry powder to red pepper flakes), then stir to combine. Add a little
        oil if needed to help create paste like mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in coconut milk and stock until mixture is well combined. Add in
        chickpeas and bring to a simmer. Allow curry to simmer for 20-25 minutes
        to reduce and become creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in your spinach to wilt and gently cook until ready 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
